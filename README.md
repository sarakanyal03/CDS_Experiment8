# Experiment8
# AIM 
To study and implement C++ 2D array matrices
# THEORY
Matrices in C++ are represented as 2D arrays. They are used to store and manipulate data in a structured, tabular form. <BR>
1)Introduction to Matrices  <BR>
A matrix is a collection of elements arranged in rows and columns.  <BR>
In C++, matrices are typically implemented using 2D arrays. <BR> 
2) Declaring a Matrix <BR>
syntax for declaring a 2D array (matrix) <BR>
```
data_type matrix_name[rows][columns];
```
3) Initializing a Matrix <BR>
for eg <br>
```
int matrix[3][3] = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};
```
4) Accessing Elements of a Matrix <br>
Elements of a matrix are accessed using row and column indices. <br>
For eg.
```
int value = matrix[1][2];
```
